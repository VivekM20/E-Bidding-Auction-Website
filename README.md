# E-Bidding-Auction-Website
This Project allows multiple users to Bid at a product at the same time and then the highest bidder will get the item.

A user would login with their username and password and start a bid on a particular item and at the same time another user logged in would have to bid on the same item, the data 
of both the users or multiple users would be compared in the background and the the Result page would be displayed.This was hosted on a Xampp server.
